# 1. Purpose

The Beman Project is dedicated to providing the guidance and facilities to ensure the highest quality libraries in ISO standard C++. We help library authors with development best practices, peer review, and contributing to the C++ standard. We distribute the libraries proposed for standardization to facilitate early usage and feedback.

The Beman project is named in memory of Beman Dawes - co-founder of [Boost](https://www.boost.org).

# 2. Membership

## 2.1 Membership Criteria:

Membership in the Beman Project is open to individuals and organizations actively contributing to the development of libraries proposed to the WG21 C++ Standard. Contributors must adhere to the organization's code of conduct.  Members are individuals who fill a role in the project structure.

## 2.2 Membership Rights and Responsibilities:

Members are expected to contribute positively to the organization, uphold its values, and respect fellow members.

# 3. Project Structure

## 3.1 Beman Project Leads:

The Beman Project Leads are responsible for maintaining the Library Acceptance and Incubating process.  This includes strategic planning, setting goals, and ensuring the organization's objectives are met.  This team should broadly understand both the Standardization process, the needs of library developers, and the concerns from Committee Members.  The Beman Project Leads ultimately approve or change the process that we use for exposing Beman Libraries to the wider community.
